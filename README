Bzet.h can be found at https://github.com/achow/Bzet
Code used to generate JWB-unified-file.txt, the input file, can be found at http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dnazip/index.html
The code for the WAH* implementation used can be found at https://github.com/stefanwoj89/BZET-RLE-API
The code for FastBit WAH was provided by Kesheng Wu.

Defines when using Bzet.h:
    BZET_IMPL_  Including Bzet.h also includes the Bzet implementation
    NODE_ELS    Flavor of Bzet to use, default 8, must be a power of 2 greater 
                than 4
    STEP_BYTES  Size of auxiliary array elements, recommended default is 2

Input to all programs is JWB-unified-file.txt from stdin.
